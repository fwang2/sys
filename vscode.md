## settings

My vscode settings maintained by 
[Settings
Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync),
and periodically committed to [vscode configuration](./vscode).

The actual settings is synced at
[https://gist.github.com/fwang2/822c5dd94a75b8873c7f46b7a6d73436](https://gist.github.com/fwang2/822c5dd94a75b8873c7f46b7a6d73436)

## Juypter notebook

As of March, 2020, Microsoft Python extension integrated the support.
To verify that you can create a new notebook (by `CMD+Shift+P`)

    python -m jupyter notebook --version
 
should return okay from your command line.


## Usage Pattern

This is a list of things I often do.
