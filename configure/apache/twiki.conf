# We set an environment variable called anonymous_spider
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents TWiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other TWikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a twiki
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker anonymous_spider
BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ anonymous_spider


# This specifies the options on the TWiki scripts directory. The ExecCGI
